# a-list
An old list of celebrity gossip from 2004. We're taking **only the rumored relationship parts** and turning it into a graph at https://graphcommons.com/graphs/cc044ceb-6876-4385-b785-28e39f44c11f. 

Join Graph Commons, add yourself as editor to this graph and start working on it. Delete the relationships you have entered from the list here.

The untouched version of the list can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13y2MI-Z2kkzXdS3Ui836EzGPvQVONPPA/view?usp=sharing. It's from alt.gossip.celebrities
